The format of a Polaris REST command is:
<protocol>://<host>:<port>/<context>/rest/api/<version>/<resource>/<action>/<id>?<params> 

where:

<protocol> = The transport protocol, typically http.
<host> = The IP host name, such as localhost.
<port = The port number, such as 8080
<webapp> = The name of the web application hosting the services, such as polaris. Note that all REST commands also require a webapp parameter. The webapp parameter specifies the specific web application for the command to operate on. The web application specified in the parameter can be different from the web application you post to, as long as it is deployed in the same EAR file.
rest/api = Standard namespace path used for all REST commands
<version> = The version of the service, such as LATEST, 1.0.0, 1.0.2
<resource> = The type of polaris resource the command operates on, such as settings, nodes, messages, properties
<action> = The specific action to take, such as list, delete, add, and get.
<id> = The unique id of the resource.
<params> A list of command-specific URL parameters. Commonly used parameters are described in Commonly Used REST Command Parameters.
